    In the Introduction to HTML module we covered what HTML is, and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents
    will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and
    have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you
    are seeing is the browser's default styles â€” very basic styles that the browser applies to HTML to make sure it will
    be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.
